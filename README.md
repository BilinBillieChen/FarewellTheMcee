Cabaret at the Kit Kat Club is a Broadway show, and Cabaret is an iconic American musical with music by John Kander, lyrics by Fred Ebb, and a book by Joe Masteroff. I am deeply impressed by the character of The Emcee, who embodies truth, beauty, bravery, and darkness. The Emcee serves as both a guide to ecstatic joy and a puppet of harsh reality.

Inspired by this character, I created an interactive visual art piece in a game-like form. In this work, the audience directs a crown-like non-player character (NPC) through a maze-like layout. The space key allows the audience to reset the layout at any time, generating a completely new version while erasing the old one. However, if the audience treats the experience as a game and successfully guides the crown-like character to the end, they encounter a "farewell" pronouncement. At that point, the ability to reset is lost forever.

This piece reflects my quest to understand the essence of The Emcee. I feel a profound pain in exploring this character, who is born from social unrest and extreme repression. The inclusion of the "farewell" scene represents my yearning for an ideal realityâ€”a goodbye to The Emcee as a symbol of pain and conflict. In that final moment, a static and peaceful setting emerges, embodying a hopeful wish for tranquility and resolution.
